# Document Upload Reference

This folder contains rule files for an opt-in document upload + RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) reference implementation. These rules describe a specific product domain: streaming uploads to Blob Storage, indexing through a Service Bus worker, vector search, citations, and conversation history.

## When to keep this folder

Keep these rules if your project ships any of:

- File upload to Azure Blob Storage with batch grouping
- Document text extraction (Azure Document Intelligence or similar)
- Vector search / embeddings for RAG
- LLM Q&A with citations against uploaded documents
- Conversation history with token-budget trimming

## When to delete it

If your project does not ship a document/RAG pipeline, delete this folder and the matching skill folder:

```
rm -rf .claude/rules/dev/document-pipeline
```

You can also strip the `Document upload`, `Document processing`, `Vector search`, `Citations`, and `Conversation history` rows from the rule tables in the root `CLAUDE.md` and `api/CLAUDE.md`. The rest of the template stands on its own.
