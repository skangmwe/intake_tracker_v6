# /dev-remediation — Fix review and scanner findings

Applies fixes to issues identified by `/dev-code-review`, `/dev-security-review`, or external tools (GitLeaks, SonarQube, Dependabot, `npm audit`, `dotnet list package --vulnerable`).

## Input Sources

1. **Internal** — structured outcome report from `/dev-code-review` or `/dev-security-review` (includes file, line, severity, finding).
2. **External** — raw output or description from GitLeaks, SonarQube, Dependabot alerts, or `npm audit`. May require additional context-gathering.

## Workflow

1. **Parse the finding** from `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - If it includes structured context (file, line, component) → it came from an internal review. Locate the code directly.
   - If it's a raw error description → it came from an external scanner. Read the referenced file to gather context. If there's not enough context, ask the developer.

2. **Classify the fix type**:
   - **Auto-fixable**: mechanical issues with a clear, deterministic fix (see lists below).
   - **Manual**: complex issues requiring developer judgment or architectural decisions.

3. **For auto-fixable issues**:
   a. Apply the fix.
   b. Show the before/after diff.
   c. Ask the developer for approval.
   d. If rejected, revert and flag for manual review.

4. **For manual issues**:
   a. Describe the problem with full context.
   b. Suggest a remediation approach with code examples.
   c. Reference the relevant rule or security checklist item.
   d. Leave the implementation to the developer.

5. **After all fixes**, re-run the appropriate review (`/dev-code-review` or `/dev-security-review`) to verify the fixes resolved the findings.
